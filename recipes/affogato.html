    <h2>What Is An Affogato?</h2>

    <p>Some say an affogato (meaning “drowned” in Italian) is like an upgraded iced latte, but I think it’s on another level entirely. The coffee-based dessert, which is served in cafes and gelato shops all over Italy, is made with just three ingredients — espresso, gelato, and a shot of liqueur — but when the hot espresso gets poured over the cold gelato, it is pure bliss. In fact, it’s the most perfect single-serve dessert I know how to make.</p>
    <p>With our travels to Italy currently on pause, I’m here to show you how to make the very best affogato at home (even if you don’t have an espresso machine!). Bear in mind <em>a classic affogato is made with two cups gelato to one shot of espresso</em>. Trust me: If you like the sound of sweet and creamy gelato mingling with the strong flavor of espresso, an affogato is the treat for you.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 shot espresso</li>
        <li>2 scoops vanilla gelato or ice cream</li>
        <li>1 splash amaretto</li>
        <li>Shaved dark chocolate, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Equipment</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Small drinking glass</li>
        <li>Ice cream scoop</li>
        <li>Espresso maker</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Brew the espresso.</em> Using your desired brewing method, brew 1 shot espresso.</li>
        <li><em>Scoop the ice cream.</em> As the espresso is brewing, drop 2 scoops vanilla gelato or ice cream into a small drinking glass.</li>
