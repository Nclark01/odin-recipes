    <h2>What Is Ginger Ale?</h2>

    <p>Ginger ale is a carbonated, non-alcoholic beverage that can be traced back to 1850s Ireland. It's said that Irish apothecary owner Thomas Joseph Cantrell created the sweet, ginger-based drink in Belfast. A dryer, less sweet style of ginger ale was created in the early 1900s by Canadian pharmacist John J. McLaughlin. He patented the drink as Canada Dry Ginger Ale.</p>
    <p>The basis of ginger ale is <em>carbonated water, ginger, and sugar</em>. The drink can be enjoyed on its own or as a mixer for alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.</p>
